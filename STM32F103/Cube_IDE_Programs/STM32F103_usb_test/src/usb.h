The USB communication is driven by the PC. The PC tells when it wants to receive or send data and how
much (up to 64 bytes per package). In addition the PC sends a SOF package every 1 ms to check if the
connection is alive.

When the SOF packages are missing, then the USB interface goes into suspend mode. Then the app may read
remaining characters from the Rx buffer but sending is blocked (except function UsbSendChar_noWait(),
which can fill the Tx buffer anyway).

Whenever the µC receives a package from the PC, an interrupt occurs. So the whole communication is driven
by interrupts. There is no need for a background thread. The ISR must respond every package, or the PC
will drop the connection (after some few repetitions). You have to avoid blocking interrupts for more
than one 1ms.

The application interface provides many functions which can wait until a timeout of some milliseconds.
Please note that this timeout depends on counting the regular SOF packages from PC. So the actual time
may be a little longer than requested, specially when the connection drops.

When the connection drops, the buffers are not cleared. You can re-establish the connection, then the
data transfer continues without loosing a single character.

There is no way for the STM32 to find out if an application on the PC side has opened the virtual COM port.
If the virtual COM port is not opened, the Tx buffer will fill up quickly. But you can check the USB
connection with function UsbActive().

When the Rx buffer of the STM32 is full, then the PC cannot send more data to the STM32. In this case,
the Tx buffer on the PC side will fill up. It's up to the PC application what happens then.

For the other direction where the STM32 send data to the PC, a timeout may occur when the communication
gets stuck. The API reports back how many characters have been written into the buffer. Your application
must decide what to do in that case (discard the remaining characters or try to repeat).
